<h1 style="text-align:center; color:black"> Q3, 2021 </h1>
  <p> &nbsp; </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>


  <p>Starting weight: 192(?) lbs</p>
  <p>...Note: Same as q2: This is very heavy for me.  Typically I am 172 - 176</p>
  <p>Starting fitness level: Intermediate.  I finished an 8 week training routine in q2.  Gained strength and muscle mass.</p>
  <p>...Note: Body is still a bit "creeky" after 1 year of limited activity due to covid quarantining, no traveling, no sports.  I had been doing light home workouts 3x week.  But nothing to prevent 20 lbs of weight gain.</p>
  <p>Goals: 196 -- 193 -- 190 -- 192 --189 -- 186 -- 188 (end of September)</p>
  <p>Enjoy summer but don't get back up to 192.  Try to prioritize active travel.  Always accept opportunities to walk far.</p>
  <p>General attainable weight loss guidance: Lose 3 lbs per month, allow 3rd month to gain 2 back.  So 196--193--190--192
  <p>Loose goal: 188.  That would be 3 pounds per month.</p>
  <p>This strategy allows more passive weight loss without major unsistainable lifestyle changes.</p>

    <p> &nbsp; </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Most of Q3 spent traveling -- Goal is to do home workout 4 - 5 days / week.<br><br><br>
    Accept all invitations for active activities.  Long walks, hikes, etc.  Still eat and drink as you like.  Let activity handle weight loss goals.
<br>Example workouts: Pushups, incline push ups, planks, 1 legged squats, side dumbbell (backpack) delt raise, dumbbell (backpack) curls, back-focused push up, 1 legged glute raise
<br> Remember to do 1 week stretching / yoga at the end of the quarter.<br>
Note: I also had a red patch develop on my chest, and redness in my face.<br>
This turned out to likely be fungal: I showered 2-3x/day and treated with econazole/mikonazole 2-3 times per day.  After 6 weeks, the patches were reduced significantly.<br> Also changed towels every 2-3 days and washed clothes after every use.
Will seek help from dermatologist. Previously treated as psoriasis with little results.

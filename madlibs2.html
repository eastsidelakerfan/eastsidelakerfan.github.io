<meta name="description" content="Between 2016 - 2018, I hosted over 100 travelers in my living room in NYC.
After our guest's stay, we would write references for one another on Couchsurfing.com.
Here are our references, turned into a Madlibs game, which we loved to play with our guests. 
We hope you enjoy!">
